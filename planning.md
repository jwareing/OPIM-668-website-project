# Website Planning Document
### Subject Matter
The site will be a page with information about Fredericksburg, Texas, which is a small town in the Texas Hill Country where I have spent a lot of time with my family.

The site should show some nice photos of Fredericksburg, and describe some of the fun things to see and do in town. I basically want this to be like a tourism brochure but in website form.

### Content and Layout
The site should have a cool-looking landing page with a nice photo to represent Fredericksburg when people arrive on the page.

I think the main page itself should have information on what there is to see and do in and around Fredericksburg. Maybe it can highlight a few specific local businesses. I would like it if there was a carousel that let people navigate to specific sub-categories on the page.

I think the last page should have details about how to get to Fredericksburg, and maybe a map? Maybe have some contact details for the Fredericksburg department of commerce or something like that.
